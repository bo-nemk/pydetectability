# Implementation of Taal distortion detectability
Implementation is based on the original paper "A Low-complexity spectro-temporal based perceptual model" and the code provided on https://ceestaal.nl/code/.

## Model Implementation
The model proposed a "perceptual distance measure" by computing the distance between the internal representation of a clean and degraded audio stimuli.
